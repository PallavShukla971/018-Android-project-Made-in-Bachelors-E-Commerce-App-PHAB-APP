It's an E-commerce app built to save paper or we can say the reuse of paper.
The idea behind this is that most of the matter that are not updated every year when we are studying at a university can be re-used

So most of the time we print the slides and notes from the professor so that can be transferred to new upcoming batches for a free or minimal amount, in the goodwill about saving papers and saving the earth.
